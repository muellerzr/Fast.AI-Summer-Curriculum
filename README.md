# My Fast.AI Summer Curriculum Attempt

The goal of this repository (and my own personal goal) is to complete all but Deep Learning 
from the Foundations within the next 8 week period. This repository has all of the notes from each course.

The overall schedule is as follows:

3 Hrs on Matrix Calculus a week
3 Hrs on Linear Algebra a week
4 Hrs on NLP a week
4 Hrs on From the Foundations a week

Ideally I should finish them all by 8/27/2019, when the Fall Semester starts up at my University.
